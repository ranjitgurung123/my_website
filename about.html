    <h1>What is Nature?</h1>
    <p>Nature typically refers to the natural world and everything in it that is not made or significantly influenced by humans. It encompasses the physical world, including plants, animals, landscapes, weather, and geological features. Nature can be seen in forests, oceans, mountains, deserts, rivers, and other environments. It's the interconnected web of life, where each component plays a role in maintaining the balance and sustainability of ecosystems. Nature is often appreciated for its beauty, diversity, and the sense of wonder it evokes in people. It's also a source of inspiration, scientific study, and recreation for many.</p>
